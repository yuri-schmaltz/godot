# Documentation

This directory hosts tools and configuration files used to generate the engine's class reference and API documentation.

The full user documentation is maintained separately in the [godot-docs repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs) and published on [docs.godotengine.org](https://docs.godotengine.org).

## Generating the class reference

Run `make` in this folder to rebuild the XML class reference using Doxygen. Generated files are placed in `doc/classes`.
